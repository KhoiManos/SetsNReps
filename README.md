### Gym Tracker

#### Overview
My current personal gym tracker is a Java-based application designed to track my workouts and monitor progress. Soon I will extend it to a general gym tracker for any user with individiual exercises and training-split-days.
This project utilizes SQLite for data storage and JavaFX for a user-friendly interface.

#### What does this tracker contain?
- **Exercise Tracking:** Log exercises with attributes like name, reps, and sets.
- **Workout Sessions:** Record individual workout sessions, including sets, reps and weight.

soon:
- **Data Visualization:** Use charts to visualize progress over time.

#### Project Structure
**Exercise Class:** Represents exercises with relevant attributes.
**WorkoutSession Class:** Logs workout details.
**Database Class:** Handles SQLite database connections and operations.
